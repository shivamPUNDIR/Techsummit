          <p>Pull Requests are one of most essential workflow pieces of modern application development. If used effectively with proper code review and your existing workflow, they can not only help ensure high quality of written code, but do so without sacrificing the speed of development. We'll start out by looking at what makes a great pull request, and what barriers people have with sending and receiving them.</p><p>Next, we'll remove some of those barriers by discussing some code review best practices to ensure the code we're writing is well written and well tested. Lastly, we'll see how and why these pieces are a crucial part of a proper workflow, and what advantages the GitHub Flow has.</p>

          <h3>Code Review</h3><p>GitHub Pull Requests have always had "review comments", which allow teams to do informal code review. But teams had to implement their own cultural norms for deciding when a Pull Request is ready to be merged. Code review improvements introduce the ability to request changes or approve pull requests with the intent of eliminating ambiguity around next steps and helping hold one another accountable to ship quality code.</p><h3>Projects</h3><p>Project management is about easily finding and organizing information to do work. Projects on GitHub aim to simplify the way issues and pull requests within any given repository are coordinated and prioritized. Within a Project, columns can be created and named to represent different categories of work. Issues, pull requests and notes can then be added to and moved around between columns according to the changing needs of a project.</p>

          <p>Diversity and inclusion have become hot topics in technology, but you may not know how you can make a difference. This talk will help you understand that, no matter your background, you have privilege and can lend it to marginalized groups in tech.</p><p>Privilege is access to societal and economic benefits based on a characteristic you possess. The most well understood forms of privilege are the ones most people don't choose for themselves like parental, racial, gendered, and physical privilege. However, there are also selected privileges like religion, gender identity, and education.</p><p>This session will teach attendees how to lend their privilege. They will learn three types of privilege lending including credibility lending (where you attach your name to a project being undertaken by someone without privilege), access lending (where you provide access to a position, location or event), and expertise lending (where you give the opportunity to be recognized as an expert). These different types of privilege lending will be illustrated through well known examples and concrete examples of how they can play out in the technology industry.</p>

In this session we'll look at some of the amazing things you can create using features and tools Electron inherits from the Chromium browser, Node.js, and the vast ecosystem of npm modules.

          Code Review is not a new concept, but a specific term for an older concept -- Peer Review -- that focuses the review process on the code under examination instead of the person who submitted it. While Code Review is common in open source projects, organizations developing in private often employ inefficient, frustrating, or virtually non-existent review processes. This talk looks at Code Review from an architect's viewpoint, arguing that Code Review is an essential component in a product's architectural plan because of the quality attributes it may provide. It also covers tips and sets expectations for what Code Review can and cannot solve.

This talk will explore how to leverage key features and tools to establish best practices in an agile environment. We'll look at ways to measure if your team is using GitHub Enterprise effectively and how to socially engineer maximum transparency and collaboration. Focus will be placed on the importance of providing early code reviews using BDD and TDD methodologies. Finally, we will see a ChatOps based Standup tool to keep your team on the same page.

          We live in rich times where we can find answers to our technical issues via Google and StackOverflow. However there are answers about "local" knowledge (architecture, domain, release procedures, coding practices, etc.) which are not as easily found. These questions and answers are passed as tribal knowledge from developer to developer. We wanted to find a better way to share this information. Our team introduced a learning repository utilizing GitHub and Markdown, using the same workflow and diligence used for writing software in capturing our "local" knowledge. This system has made it easier to get new team members onboarded and saves time for our more seasoned developers.

          In The Hitchhikers’s Guide to the Galaxy, the Babel Fish is a universal translator. By allowing all beings to communicate regardless of language, it ‘neatly crosses the language divide between any species’. Most programming languages are designed for English speakers, and most open source projects require some familiarity with English. How do we create a multilingual programming language and a multilingual open source community, allowing developers who only speak English to collaborate on open-source projects with developers who don't speak English at all?

          <p>The current status quo in running and scaling out teams is to have everyone work in the same or at least in different office. With the rise of open source, a different model of working and collaborating has emerged that is adopted by more and more companies, especially as they struggle to hire talent, build diverse teams and keep up with economies of scale that haven’t existed before.</p><p>In this talk I’d like to to talk about how the team that’s running Travis CI, a continuous integration platform, and share some of our learnings as we grew our team and pushed our team’s distribution further. The talk will focus on how to structure communication in distributed and remote teams, the tools that are available today to increase collaboration while also increasing visibility, and on the challenges of working across multiple timezones and countries.</p><p>After this session you will be better equipped with tools that can help your team adopt a more asynchronous and inclusive culture of working, and you’ll walk away with ideas on how to structure communication and collaboration in distributed teams in a way that helps local teams as well.</p>

          GitHub hosts tens of millions of repositories on hundreds of file servers. The Git Infrastructure team runs Git as a distributed service, providing highly available and durable access to repositories, despite frequent hardware and software failures. One key part of the service is Spokes, a self-healing replication, routing, and load-balancing layer built on top of Git. Learn about how Spokes detects failures and routes around them to provide high availability. Hear about how Spokes uses real-time replication and voting to durably store repository content. Watch as we induce failures and, ideally, no one notices.
